## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a final project a MERN full-stack app that solves one of the
major concerns of hikers - let the family know your location almost in
real-time, so in case of emergency, the family could find a hiker. A
possible use case: before going to track user adds likely coordinates
in-app and then in real-time user updates when he passes the spot so
family and friends could see the user's location.
